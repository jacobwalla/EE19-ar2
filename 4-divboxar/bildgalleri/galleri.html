                Symere Bysil Woods (born July 31, 1994), known professionally as Lil Uzi Vert, is an American rapper,
                singer, and songwriter. Characterized by his face tattoos, facial piercings, eccentric hairstyles and
                androgynous fashion, his music is defined by often dark subject matters and imagery built on a
                melodic emo approach to trap. Born and raised in Philadelphia, Lil Uzi gained initial recognition
                following the release of the commercial mixtape Luv Is Rage (2015), which led to a recording contract
                with Atlantic Records, to whom he signed to under DJ Drama's Generation Now imprint.
