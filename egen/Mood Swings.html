    <h1>Mood Swings - Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay</h1>
    <p>
        [Intro: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]<br>
        (Mood swings)<br>
        Oh, you ain't know I could sing? (Oh, oh, oh)<br>
        Hahaha (Yeah)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]<br>
        Shorty a lil' baddie (She a lil' baddie)<br>
        Shorty my lil' boo thing (Boo thing)<br>
        And shorty got the fatty<br>
        Shorty be catching mood swings<br>
        Every time I fuck without a rubber<br>
        I nutted on the covers<br>
        And I kept it undercover<br>
        'Cause I don't kiss and tell (Kiss and tell)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        [Verse 1: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]<br>
        Every time I fuck, she call me daddy<br>
        My lil' mama nasty<br>
        I see the pussy through the panties (Whatever you want)<br>
        She taste like candy<br>
        She a queen, like Nefertiti<br>
        Uh oh, my lil' mama sittin' pretty<br>
        And we be shoppin' through the city (Oh, oh)<br>
        I gave her keys to the Bentley (Woah, woah)<br>
        Get off your knees, you don't gotta cry to me<br>
        I'm your best friend, baby, you don't gotta lie<br>
        I'll get you everything that you want and that you need from Chanel to<br> Celine<br>
        It's on you to decide<br>
        Valentino, yeah, I put you in the best<br>
        Start liftin' up your dress, start kissin' on your neck (Oh no, no)<br>
        Start rubbin' on your butt, start massagin' your breasts
        I ain't wanna give you a baby just yet, so I backed out and nutted on<br> your breasts<br>
        I put you in a Uber (Uber) and sent you to your bed (Oh)<br>
        The very next day (Oh), you sent me a text (Oh)<br>
        You pulled up to the crib and we did it again (Oh, oh)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]<br>
        Shorty a lil' baddie (She a lil' baddie)<br>
        Shorty my lil' boo thing (Boo thing)<br>
        And shorty got the fatty<br>
        Shorty be catching mood swings<br>
        Every time I fuck without a rubber<br>
        I nutted on the covers<br>
        And I kept it undercover<br>
        'Cause I don't kiss and tell (Ooh)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        [Verse 2: Lil Tjay & Pop Smoke]<br>
        You know, I never found love until I looked into your eyes (Until I<br> looked into your eyes)<br>
        First time blushin', I ain't even gon' lie (Ain't even gon' lie)<br>
        Four rounds in, leavin' bruises on your thighs<br>
        You the only bitch could make me spin off on the guys<br>
        And the only bitch that make me wanna nut when I'm inside<br>
        It's your vibe, leave with me you gettin' high<br>
        Girl, ain't bitches fuckin' wit' you even if they tried<br>
        She a tsunami, I ain't never felt it dry<br>
        Close my eyes while I sleep, hope you be there when I wake<br>
        Honestly, I feel the vibe we have is great<br>
        And if there's something in your mind, you can tell me<br>
        And if I told you what's on mine, would you help me?<br>
        You gon' see the bigger picture, it's just gon' take time<br>
        Just because you mine, I'ma keep you lookin' like a dime<br>
        Ain't no imperfections, girl, you fine<br>
        Baby, what's your sign?<br>
        I hope you ain't against the slow grind<br>
        (Work, work, it's me and you) Me and you<br>
        Keep it silent, there ain't nothin' we can't do<br>
        Through the storm, baby, we can make it through<br>
        Why you actin' brand new? You know you my lil' boo, yeah<br>
        Got up on my Birkin, it's workin'<br>
        She said she a virgin (It's hurtin')<br>
        She my biggest fan, she always lurkin'<br>
        And she know I'm a man, I'ma put that work in<br>
        I know she can't stand me, I'm fancy<br>
        So I'ma bring her out when I get my Grammy<br>
        Late night sex, she can't find her panties<br>
        Couldn't hold it in, now she need a plan B<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]<br>
        Shorty a lil' baddie<br>
        She my lil' boo thing<br>
        And shorty got the fatty (Shorty got the fatty)<br>
        Shorty be catching mood swings<br>
        Every time I fuck without a rubber<br>
        I nutted on her covers<br>
        And I kept it undercover<br>
        'Cause I don't kiss and tell<br>
    </p>
